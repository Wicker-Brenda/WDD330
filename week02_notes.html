  <h2>Javascript: Novice to Ninja Chapters 2-4 </h2>
  <ul>
      <li>Primitive data types are: strings, symbols, numbers, Booleans, undefined and null. Non-primitives are a type of object: arrays, functions, objects.</li>
      <li>Declare variables using let or const, not var. Points to values stored in memory, more than one variable may point to the same value.</li>
      <li>Be very explicit about data types of values, if change is needed do it manually- don't rely on type conversion which behaves inconsistently.</li>
      <li>Symbols have unique immutable values.</li>
      <li>Nine falsy values: "", '', ``, 0, -0, Nan, false, null, undefined.</li>
      <li>Best way to create an array: const myArray = [];</li>
      <li>Array delete operator will remove value but leave space it occupied as undefined.</li>
      <li>Array properties and methods: length property is mutable. pop() method returns last item of array and removes it. shift() method returns and removes first item of array. 
          push() method appends new value to end of array. unshift() method appends new value to beginning of array. concat() method creates another array combining arrays- original 
          arrays unchanged. join() method turns array into string with all items separated by default commas, can place another separate in parentheses. slice() method creates subarray 
          from 2 positions placed in parentheses- non-destructive as no items are removed from original array. splice() method removes items from array and inserts new items in their 
          place- destructive- (beginning positions, how many to remove, replacement values). reverse() method changes order of array permanently. sort() method permanently changes 
          order alphabetically- numbers sorted by first digit! indexOf() method returns index of first instance of that value in array, or -1 if not in array. includes() method returns 
          boolean indicating presence of value, can indicate which index to start search from.  </li>
      <li>Spread operator (new to ES6): place three dots in front of an array (...myArray) to spread out the elements of that array. Can also flatten Multidimensional arrays, so all 
          values are on the same level in the array.</li>
      <li>Multidimensional (nested) arrays: access values with 2 indices, one each to refer to the item's place in outer and inner arrays</li>
      <li>Sets (new to ES6) = ordered lists of non-duplicate values, use new operator and Set() constructor. Use add() method to add separate words, size() method to find number of values, 
          has() method to check if a value is in a set- returns a boolean. There is no index notation for inspecting individual entries. Use delete() method to remove a value, clear() method 
          to remove all values. Convert set to an array by placing it inside array literal and using spread operator: const myArray = [...set]; 
          Or use Array.from() method: const myArray = Array.from(set);. Weak sets will garbage collect references to objects that no longer exist, must manually create: const weak = new WeakSet(); 
      </li>
      <li>Maps (new to ES6) =  ordered lists of key-value pairs. Methods: set() adds key-value pair to map, get() looks up a value, has() checks if a key is in a map, delete() removes 
          key-value pair from map- specify key to be removed. Size property returns number of key-value pairs in map. Use spread operator or Array.from() method to convert map into nested 
          array. Weak maps work like weak sets.</li>
      <li>Logic- control flow of program using if and else statements. Ternary operator ? format: condition ? (code if true) : (code if false);</li>
      <li>Switch statment can replace multiple if and else statements.</li>
      <li>While loop repeats a block of code while condition is still true. Do ... while loop has condition after block of code, so will always run at least once.   </li>
      <li>For loop also repeats while condition is true- clearest loop as all details are in one place, and out of block of code. For loops can be nested.</li>
      <li>For-of loops can be used to iterate over arrays, maps, and sets. </li>
      <li>Functions are defined using a function declaration or by creating a function expression (assigning an anonymous function to a variable).</li>
      <li>Arrow functions (new to ES6) are shorthand anonymous functions, best for one line. const square = x => x*x; Multiple parameters go in parentheses, no parameters use empty parentheses. </li>
      <li>Functions always return a value; undefined is default. Invoke a function: name(); </li>
      <li>Parameters are values a function needs and are set when the function is defined. Arguments are values passed to the function when it is invoked.</li>
      <li>Rest operator (new to ES6) deals with multiple arguments by creating an array of arguments available inside the body of the function. Place 3 dots in front of the last parameter 
          in a function declaration, which will collect all the arguments entered into an array: function rest(...args) {return args;} Can use for-of loop to iterate over each value given as an argument.</li>
      <li>Default parameters are plugged in if none is passed as an argument. Should only come after non-default parameters. function hello(name='World') { console.log('Hello ${name}!'); }</li>
      <li>Hoisting: Function declarations are hoisted to the top of the scope so can be invoked before they are defined. Function expressions cannot be invoked until after they are defined. 
          Variable declarations using var keyword are hoisted to the top of the current scope, BUT variable assignment is not hoisted and will return undefined until the assignment is made. 
          Better practice is to use const and let to declare variables at the beginning of a block. 
      </li>
      <li>Callbacks are functions provided as an argument to another function.</li>
