  <h1>Week 9 Notes</h1>
  <h2>Javascript: Novice to Ninja, chapters 9 and 14</h2>
  <ul>
      <li>The window object is the global object in the browser. Global variables are properties of the window object in a browser environment. You can quickly assign the variable 
          global to the global object from within the global scope: const global = this; 
      </li>
      <li>alert(), confirm(), and prompt() are methods of the global object. They all open dialogs that halt execution of the program. alert() just displays a 
          message. confirm() displays a confirmation message, giving options of OK or Cancel, returns boolean. prompt() displays the message, with an input field for the user 
          to enter text which is returned as a string when the user clicks OK, null is returned if the user clicks Cancel. Use these methods with caution: 1) they stop execution of 
          the program, 2) users can disable dialogs from appearing. 
      </li>
      <li>The window.navigator object gives information about the user's browser and operating system. Can be unreliable as it can be modified by the user. Can be difficult to read 
          as all browsers mimic others to some extent. </li>    
      <li>The window.location object provides information about the URL of the current page. It includes the href, protocol, host, hostname, port, pthname, search, hash, and 
          origin properties. It also includes the reload(), assign(), replace(), and toString() methods. </li>
      <li>Browser history: the window.history object keeps information about pages that have been visited in that session. It includes a length property and go(), forward(), and 
          back() methods.</li>
      <li>Controlling windows: you can open, close, resize, and move windows but it is almost always a bad idea.</li>
      <li>Screen information: the window.screen object contains information about the user's screen. Use with care, media queries and feature detection are better practices.</li>
      <li>The document.write() method is an archaic way of writing text to the document, it should be avoided. It heavily mixes javascript into the HTML document, and will completely 
          replace the current document in an already loaded page. </li>
      <li>Cookies: use the document.cookie property to store small pieces of information between requests. Javascript cookie handling is cumbersome, consider using a library such as 
        https://github.com/ScottHamper/Cookies or https://github.com/js-cookie/js-cookie 
      </li>
      <li>Timing functions: setTimeout()method can be used to invoke a function after a set amount of time. It can be canceled with the clearTimeout() method. setInterval() method 
          can be used to repeatedly invoke a function. It can be stopped using the clearInterval() method. BE CAREFUL using the this keyword with either timing function, as this is 
          set to the window object not the method's object, and can get unexpected results. If must use, bind this to the object instead. See page 494 of Javascript: Novice to Ninja, 
          or https://www.javascripttutorial.net/javascript-bind/
      </li>    
      <li>Animation: requestAnimationFrame() method can be used to produce smooth/optimized animation by utilizing the browser's built-in graphics capabilities. It can be canceled 
          with cancelAnimationFrame(). In general, it is better to use CSS for any animation effects instead.
      </li>
      <li>HTML5: the latest version of Hyper Markup Language used to create web pages. It includes a variety of technologies, including several API's that are accessible with 
          JavaScript. New features are continually being developed, check to see if a feature is ready for use with https://caniuse.com/ 
          </li>
      <li>data- attributes are used to embed custom data in a web page that is ignored by the browser. They are solely used by the Javascript program, and are perfect for adding data that 
          can be a hook to access information about a particular element on a page. See https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_global_data.asp for creating a data- attribute, and 
          https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-get-the-data-attributes-of-an-element-using-javascript/?ref=rp for using getAttribute() to access it.</li>
      <li>Because API's change so quickly, best practice is to use feature detection before using any API methods.</li>
      <li>Web Storage API allows key-value pairs to be stored on the user's device similar to cookies, but without those storage limitations.</li>
      <li>The Geolocation API allows you to access the geographic coordinates of a user's device, with their permission. It is a property of the navigator object, which has a 
          getCurrentPostion() method that returns a position object. For examples, see https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_api_geolocation.asp and 
          https://www.javascripttutorial.net/web-apis/javascript-geolocation/</li> 
      <li>Web Worker API: used to perform computationally heavy tasks in the background, which avoids the website becoming unresponsive. Not supported in Chrome, either use another 
          browser or use the --allow-file-access-from-files flag (only for development, not production).
      </li>    
      <li>Websockets (push messaging): a new protocol for communicating over the internet, allows real-time, two-way communication. The connection is kept open and responses are pushed 
          to the client as soon as they are received. See examples at http://websocket.org/ </li>
      <li>Notification API: allows you to display notifications on the user's system.</li>
      <li>Multimedia: audio and video elements can be used to embed audio tracks and video clips in a web page. They have a Media API that can control playback using JavaScript. Methods 
          and properties: play(), pause(), volume, muted, currentTime, playbackRate, loop, duration. Use an event listener to make sure the browser has received all the metadata associated 
        with a video. Audio and video events are: play, pause, volumechange, loadedmetadata. For a full list of properties, methods, and events for video elements: 
        https://www.w3.org/2010/05/video/mediaevents.html </li>
      <li>Other APIs: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API</li>
      <li>The canvas element can be used to dynamically draw geometric shapes, text, and images on a web page in real time using JavaScript. See notes from week 8.</li>
      <li>A shim or polyfill is a library of code that adds support of missing features to older browsers, allowing you to use the API as usual. 
          https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/wiki/HTML5-Cross-browser-Polyfills  </li>
                       
      <li>Code example: <a href="/WDD330/drums/index.html">Keyboard Drum Kit</a></li>
