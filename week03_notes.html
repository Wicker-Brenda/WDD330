  <h1>Week 3 Notes</h1>
  <h2>Javascript: Novice to Ninja Chapters 5-7 </h2>
  <ul>
      <li>Functions stored in object properties are called methods.</li>
      <li>Methods allow objects to "act" like object.doSomething().</li>
      <li>"this" keyword can be used to access information stored in objects. Better than referencing it by outer variable, because will still access 
          correct information even if original object is overwritten. Not bound, value is evaluated during the run-time and does not depend on where the method was declared, 
          but on what object is "before the dot".</li>
      <li>Arrow functions have no "this", references to "this" will go to outer normal function.</li>
      <li>An object in Javascript is a self-contained set of related values and functions. An object literal is created quickly, w/out defining a class, 
          by wrapping all properties and methods in curly braces. Example of empty object assigned to variable: const variable = {}; </li>
      <li>All objects are mutable when a program is running, even if declared using const.</li>
      <li>Access properties and methoeds with dot notation, brackets (for non-standard names, or for evaluating an expression to use as the property key).  </li>
      <li>ES6- create objects with computed property keys. </li>
      <li>Objects can be used as parameters to functions- arguments can then be entered in any order, or omitted.</li>
      <li>Use 'for in' loop to loop through all of an object's properties and methods. Use Object.keys() to return keys, Object.values() to return values, and Object.entries() to 
          return key-value pairs.</li>
      <li>Nested objects have objects inside other objects.</li>
      <li>JSON- portable data format that uses Javascript object literals to exhange information, see json.org. parse() takes a string from JSON format and returns a Javascript object. 
          stringify() takes a Javascript object and returns a string of JSON data- methods are not permitted values and will be ignored.
      </li>
      <li>Math Object gives access to some mathematical constants, and can be used to perform mathematical calculations. See https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_math.asp for a list of 
          Math Object Methods.
      </li>
      <li>Date Object can be used to create date objects. Use getter methods to access information about a date object, and setter methods to change information in a date object. 
          Remember that January = 0. Use momentjs.com as a resource to figure out dates and timezones.</li>
      <li>Regex Object can create regular expressions, which can be used to search a string for a match to that pattern. Test that your regular expression does what you think it does with 
          https://www.regextester.com/ or https://regex101.com/</li>
      <li>Document Object Model (DOM) represents a page of html as a tree of nodes. Access elements on a page with document.getElementById(), document.getElementByClassName(), 
          document.getElementsByTagNames(), and document.querySelector(). </li>
      <li>Navigate around the DOM tree with parentNode(), previousSibling(), nextSibling(), childNodes(), and children().</li>
      <li>Use getAttribute() and setAttribute() to access and update an element's attributes.</li>
      <li>Create dynamic markup with createElement() and createTextNode().</li>
      <li>Add markup to the page with appendChild() and insertBefore(). Replace elements with replaceChild(), and remove with removeChild().</li>
      <li>The innerHTML property can be used to insert raw HTML directly into the DOM.</li>
      <li>Change the CSS properties of an element by accessing the style property. Can be done from the DOM, but it is better to keep it in the separate stylesheet.</li>
      <li>Events = when a user interacts with a web page (mouse, keyboard, & touch). Event listeners attached to an element invoke a callback function when the event occurs. The 
          event object is passed to the callback function as an argument, and contains properties and methods relating to the event.</li>
      <li>Remove an even with removeEventListener().</li>
      <li>Prevent default behavior of events with preventDefault(), but not recommended.</li>
      <li>Event propagation = the order events fire on each element.</li>
      <li>Event delegation = an event listener is added to a parent element to capture events happening to children elements.</li>
      <li>Code example: <a href="week03_array_cardio.html">Array Cardio</a></li>   
</ul>
