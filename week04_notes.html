  <h2>Javascript: Novice to Ninja Chapters 8, 12, part of 15 </h2>
  <ul>
      <li>Use forms to enter data into the browser. Forms contain a form element and a variety of controls for different kinds of information. 
          The input fields can be populated with information that is processed once the form is submitted.</li>
      <li>HTML5 has form attributes, the action to be performed when the form is submitted, such as action, target, method, etc. 
            See https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms_attributes.asp </li>    
      <li>HTML5 has a large number of input types implemented in modern browsers, such as button, checkbox, email, select (drop-down lists), hidden, radio, etc. 
          See https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_form_input_types.asp</li>
      <li>Reset button should be avoided, poor usability- to easy to accidently click and wipe out your data. </li>    
      <li>Input element attributes include: value (specifies an initial value for the input field), readonly, disabled (unusable and un-clickable), placeholder, maxlength, required, etc. 
          autofocus attribute gives focus to the element when the page loads. See https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_form_attributes.asp </li>    
      <li>document.forms will return an HTML collection of all the forms on a page.</li>
      <li>form.elements will return an HTML collection of all the elements contained withing a form.</li>
      <li>Form Events: Forms have focus, blur, and change events that fire as a user interacts with the form. The submit event can intercept a form before it is submitted.</li>
      <li>The value property of the form controls can be used to read or update information entered into a form.</li>
      <li>Form Validation: best practice is to use both client-side and server side validation. 
          Do not use Javascript to validate any data before it is saved to the database, just to improve the client experience and reduce requests back and forth to the server. 
          HTML5 form validation API can be used to automatically validate a form at a basic level (add a required attribute), but error messages are inconsistent across browsers 
          and difficult to style. Custom validation script is required for anything beyond basics.</li>
      <li>Object Oriented Programming (OOP) uses objects that encapsulate their own properties and methods. Main concepts are: encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance.</li>
      <li>Constructor functions can be used to create instances of objects. ES6 introduced class declarations (class keyword) that can be used instead of constructor functions.</li>
      <li>Keyword this: inside constructor function or class declaration, this refers to the object returned by the function.</li>
      <li>All instances of a class or constructor function inherit all the properties and methods of its prototype. The prototype is LIVE, new methods and properties are added to 
          existing instances. (This can get messy!) </li>
      <li>A prototype chain is used to find an available method. If an object lacks a method, Javascript checks up the chain to see if the prototype has it, and if not will check that function's 
          prototype for it, and so on up the chain to the Object constructor function.</li>
      <li>Private properties and methods can be created by defining variables using const and defining a function inside of a constructor function. Use getter and setter functions to access them.</li>
      <li>'Monkey-patching' = adding methods to built-in objects by augmenting their prototypes. Only do with caution, can cause unexpected behavior in the way built-in objects work, 
          especially as specifications change down the road.</li>
      <li>Methods can be chained together and called in sequence if they return a reference to this. (format to put each new chain on a new line to make debugging easier)</li>
      <li>Polymorphism allows objects to override shared methods with a more specific implementation.</li>
      <li>The value of this is not retained inside nested functions, which causes errors. Fix by using that = this, using the bind(this) method, and using arrow functions.</li>    
      <li>Methods can be borrowed from other objects. A mixin method can be used to add properties and methods from other objects without creating an inheritance chain. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. With inheritance: 'You wanted a banana 
          but what you got was a gorilla holding the banana and the entire jungle.' (Joe Armstrong). HOWEVER beware of copying by reference, creates a shallow copy that points to old object. 
          Create your own mixin() function and copy() method, code examples on pp 484-485, 487. 
      </li>
      <li>To borrow array methods for array-like objects, use Array.from() or the spread operator [...variable] to turn an array-like object into an array.</li>  
      <li>'Composition over inheritance' is a design pattern where objects are composed from small 'building-block' objects, consisting of single tasks or behaviors, used to create 
          more complex objects. Objects DO NOT inherit all their properties and methods from a parent class. Excellent article about it: 
          https://medium.com/javascript-scene/the-two-pillars-of-javascript-ee6f3281e7f3 </li>
      <li>A module is a self-contained piece of code that provides functions and methods that can be used in other files and modules. Code in a module should have a single purpose, and group 
          together functions with distinct functionality. </li>
      <li>ES6 added support for modules, allowing code to be abstracted into their own self-contained files and imported into another file. Use export keyword in module file and import 
          keyword in main file. </li>       
      <li>Code example: <a href="week04_tic_tac_toe.html">Tic Tac Toe</a>. Team activity, including first stretch goal.</li>
