  <h1>Week 8 Notes</h1>
  <h2>HTML5 and CSS3 for the Real World, chapters 8 and 12</h2>
  <ul>
      <li>The CSS3 transform property lets you translate, rotate, scale, and/or skew any element on the page. The value of the transform property is 
          one or more tranform functions, separated by spaces, applied in the order provided. Don't declare multiple transforms, the cascade will have the later ones override 
          the earlier. Instead, declare one transform and have a space separated list of transform functions. For working examples, see https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_transform.asp
      </li>
      <li>Older versions of Internet Explorer (8 or older) require filters. Use http://www.useragentman.com/IETransformsTranslator/ to change your transforms into something 
          the ancient browser can understand.
      </li>
      <li>Translation functions move elements left, right (x axis); up, down (y axis). Does NOT impact flow of the document. Can only be moved relative to its current position. 
          Can move only one direction by specificing X or Y= transform: translateX(45px);  Can move both directions at once, translate(x,y) example = transform: translate(45px, -45px);
      </li>    
      <li>Transforms don't work on inline elements, add display: inline-block; </li>
      <li>scale(x,y) function scales an element horizontally then vertically; if only one value is provided it will be used for both x and y, which maintains original aspect ratio. 
          Example= transform: scale(2); will double the element. scale(1.5, 0.25) will deform it.</li>
      <li>Scaled elements grow/shrink from center point, change this default by including transform-origin property, parameters are top, center. Example= transform-origin: 10% 10%; For a 
          working example that includes the z-axis (3D), see https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_transform-origin.asp
      </li>
      <li>Scaling does NOT impact flow of document, surrounding text will not reflow. If that is needed, adjust the element's height, width, or font-size instead.  </li>
      <li>rotate() function rotates an element around the point of origin (default is center) by specified angle value. Angles are usually in degrees, positive is clockwise and negative is 
          counter-clockwise. Example= transform: rotate(10deg);. Order matters, place rotate first before translate if you want to rotate THEN move, or vice versa.
      </li>    
      <li>skew(x,y) specifies a skew along the x and y axes. If only one parameter is given, it will only skew on the x axis. Example= transform: skew(15deg, 4deg). To skew only one axis, 
          use the axis-specific version= skewY().
      </li>
      <li>Transitions (animations) do not need support for older browsers; they fail accessibly- the animation happens instantly instead of over time. Transitions are declared along with 
          the regular styles of an element. Whenever target properties change, the browser applies the transition gradually. To create a simple transition using only CSS (no JS): 
          1) declare the original state of the element in the default style declaration, 2) declare the final state of the element (ex: :hover state), 3) include the transition functions in 
          your default stayle declaration using transition properties (transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function, transition-delay)
      </li>
      <li>transition-property defines the CSS properties of the element that should be transitioned; all is the default, otherwise comma-separate the list of properties. Any property with 
          a definable midpoint can be transitioned, except for visibility which changes at the endpoint of the transition. Properties that can be animated are: 
          https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_animated_properties. Use a webkit prefix to support older browsers. 
      </li>
      <li>transition-duration sets how long the transition will take (from default state to transitioned state). Specify in seconds(s) or milliseconds(ms). Ideal length is 200ms, longer makes 
          website seem slow, faster is too subtle. By default the reverse transition (returning to original state) also takes place over the same duration. </li>
      <li>transition-timing-function lets you control pace of transition in granular detail. Most common: ease(slow start, speeds up, ends slowly); linear(animates at a constant speed); 
          ease-in(slow to start but gains speed); ease-out(starts at full speed, progressively slows as it reaches end); ease-in-out(similar to ease but accelerates more sharply at beginning). 
        Set a relatively long transition-duration when testing. Can be more precise with cubic-bezier, but the above will handle most needs. To test cubic-bezier: https://cubic-bezier.com/ or 
        http://estelle.github.io/animation/files/cubicbezierprint.html  </li>    
      <li>transition-delay can introduce a delay before the transition begins. Default is 0, begins immediately, but bad user experience if they accidentally moused over the target. A 
          50ms delay ensures they are intentionally hovering before beginning transition. Use a webkit prefix for older browsers. A negative delay starts the transition immediately, but 
          partially through the animation. 
      </li>
      <li>transition shorthand property lets you list the properties in any order, but if a delay is included must also have a duration which precedes it. Example= 
          transition: transform 0.2s ease-out 50ms;
      </li>
      <li>Multiple transitions, 3 ways: 1) Use the all keyword, and all properties will transition at the same rate, speed, and delay= transition: all 0.2s ease-out 50ms; 2) Longhand, 
          include each value in a comma-separated list using the SAME order as in the transition-property for all the transition property declarations. 3) Shorthand, 
          specify all the transition values as a shorthand for each transition, and seperate each property's transition with a comma= transition: transform 0.2s ease-out 50ms, color 0.1s linear 50ms;
      </li>
      <li>CSS animations control each step of the animation with keyframes. Placed at start, end, and any # in between. Create a named animation, then attach it to an element in it's property declaration 
          block. Use @keyframes animationName, and @-webkit-keyframes animationName for older browsers. Do not quote the animation name. Include animated properities inside the keyframe. 
          Two keyterms- from and to- evaluate to 0% and 100%, and specify how far along the animation each keyframe is located. Keyframes can be specified in any order, percentage value not 
          order of declaration determines sequence of keyframes in an animation. 
          Examples: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp, and with vendor prefixes: https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/keyframe-animation-syntax/
      </li>
      <li>Animation properties: https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_animation.asp.</li>    
      <li>animation-name is used to attach an animation to an element (must be previously definied using the @keyframes syntax). Do not put quotes around the animation name.</li>
      <li>animation-duration defines the length of time (seconds or milliseconds) it takes an animation to complete one iteration (0% - 100%). Default is 0s, not perceptible. Consisder it required.</li>
      <li>animation-timing-function determines how the animation will progress over its duration. Options are: ease, linear, ease-in, ease-out, ease-out-in, cubic-bezier() function, step-start, 
          step-end, or custom number of steps with the steps(number, direction) function.
      </li>
      <li>animation-iteration-count defines how many times the animation will play through. Default is 1 (plays once). Usually an integer, can use decimal points to play partial animations. Infinite 
          keeps animating on a loop.
      </li>
      <li>animation-direction default goes from the 0% to the 100% keyframe, jumping back to 0% to start a new direction. Change direction: reverse: starts at 100% and goes to 0%, 
          alternate: odd iterations go in default direction and even iterations go in reverse, alternate-reverse: alternates direction each iteration but starts in reverse. When animations 
          are played in reverse, timing functions are also reversed (ease-in becomes ease-out).
      </li>    
      <li>animation-delay defines how many milliseconds or seconds to wait before the browser begins the animation.</li>
      <li>animation-fill-mode definies what happens before an animation begins and after it ends. Default is none (nothing happens outside the animation). Also: forwards, backwards, both.</li>
      <li>animation-play-state defines whether the animation is running or paused. A paused animation displays the current state of the animation statically, and when it resumes it restarts 
          from the current position.
      </li>
      <li>Shorthand animation: space-separated list of values, can skip default values. Be careful with animation-name, DO NOT USE any animation property key such as forwards, running, alternate, etc. 
          To declare multiple animations on an element, include a grouping for each animation name, with each shorthand grouping separated by a comma.
      </li>
      <li>Use transforms, transitions, and animations SPARINGLY and only where it enhances the user experience. Less is more.</li>    
      <li>Use HTML5's <b>Canvas API</b> to draw and manipulate pixels using JavaScript instead of downloading images. Create a canvas element (container for the graphics) with an id and default text that is 
          only shown if the browser does not support Canvas. Set a width (default is 300) and height (default is 150), which determines how large the canvas coordinate system is. Add a border (in CSS) 
          to make it easy to see the canvas while you work with it. Example: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_canvas.asp and docs: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API
      </li>
      <li>To test pixel manipulation using canvas in Firefox or Chrome, use localhost or test it online to prevent security errors.</li>
      <li>Canvas is quicker than SVG (so better for lots of animations) and is good for manipulating pixels and video. Downsides: because it is not text-based and does not create a DOM node it is 
          not accessible to screen readers. Also, canvas operates in immediate mode, once you finish drawing a shape you cannot access it again to modify it. You can save images as a PNG or JPG. 
          Finally, Canvas does not have as many tools to help you draw images as SVG does.
      <li>Other Canvas resources: https://dev.opera.com/articles/html5-canvas-basics/, 
          https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/HTML-canvas-guide/Introduction/Introduction.html</li>    
      </li>
      <li><b>SVG</b> = Scalable Vector Graphics, a file format that lets you describe vector graphics using XML. Vector images preserve their quality even when enlarged or shrunk. 
        You can do many of the same tasks in SVG that you do in canvas- drawing paths, shapes, text, gradients, and patterns. </li>
      <li>SVG is accesible to screen readers and search engines (text-based and via the DOM). It operates in retained mode, so the structure of the image is preserved in the XML 
          document that describes it, so it can be modified. SVG has more complete tools to work with it. Downsides: slower than Canvas, and can't manipulate images by pixels 
          like you can with Canvas... no way to convert a video to black and white.</li>
      <li>Use an image editor to create SVG images, like Inkscape: https://inkscape.org/. Start with public domain images instead of from scratch, as from 
        https://openclipart.org/search/?query=weather+icons </li>
      <li>Filters in SVG are not well-supported in older browsers, it is better to change colors instead.</li>
      <li>http://raphaeljs.com/ is an open-source JavaScript library that makes drawing and animating SVG easier. Download and include raphael.js into your HTML page and then begin 
          using in your page. Raphael tutorial: https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/an-introduction-to-the-raphael-js-library--net-7186
      </li>
      <li><b>Drag and Drop API</b>. Override the default behavior elements to allow them to be dragged (set the draggable attribute to true). Add an event listener for the dragstart event 
        on any draggable elements. Add event listeners for the dragover and drop events on other elements to allow them to accept a dropped item. Tutorials on Drag and Drop:
